# NREL analysis 

The script NREL_analysis.py looks up the NREL building blocks in the 4-HAP network and checks if these were identified by the strategic molecule algorithm. 

The analysis consits of follwoing steps:
1. Loading of the network, the strategic molecules, and the NREL building blocks
2. Calculation of numebr of NREL building in Reaxys
3. Calculation of number of NREL building blocks in the 4-HAP network
4. Overlap between strategic moelcules and NREL building blocks. 

The results are documented in a text file.
