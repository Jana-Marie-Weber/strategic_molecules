# NREL analysis 

The script [NREL_analysis.py] looks up the NREL building blocks in the 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP) network and checks if these were identified by the strategic molecule algorithm.  

The analysis consists of following steps:
1. Loading of the network, the strategic molecules, and the NREL building blocks
2. Calculation of number of NREL building in Reaxys
3. Calculation of number of NREL building blocks in the 4-HAP network
4. Overlap between strategic molecules and NREL building blocks. 

The results are documented in a text file.
