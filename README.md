# Identification of strategic molecules

This repository contains teh source code for the network-based pipeline for identification of strategic molecules by (Weber et al., 2019). Due to license agreements the datamining part is not part of this repository. The pipeline outlines steps 3 to 5 assuming a network-base data collection had been assembled previously. To cite from this work use (Weber et al., 2019).
