# Identification of strategic molecules

This repository contains the source code for the network-based pipeline for the identification of strategic molecules by [(Weber et al., 2019)][1]. Due to license agreements the datamining part is not part of this repository. The pipeline outlines steps 3 to 5 assuming a network-base data collection had been assembled previously. To cite from this work use (Weber et al., 2019).
